"""
Monotonic array: write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns
a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.
(Non-increasing elements arenâ€™t necessarily exclusively decreasing;
they simply donâ€™t increase.)
